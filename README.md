  ## [Week 1 - C](/pset1)
   - [hello](pset1/hello) - A simple Hello World program in C.
   - mario
     * [less](pset1/mario/less) - A program that prints a pyramid of hashes.
     * [more](pset1/mario/more) - A program that prints more complex pyramid of hashes.
  - [cash](pset1/cash) - A program that first asks the user how much change is owed and then prints the minimum number of coins with which that change can be made using a greedy algorithm.
  - [credit](pset1/credit) - A program that checks if a credit card number is valid and prints what brand of card it is.
